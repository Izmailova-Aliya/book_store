email: user@user pas:123
Email: admin@admin pas:123

I created sessions for admin and user.
If someone sign ups, he is a USER by default. I
ONLY admin@admin is ADMIN and can edit books.
there are only 4 books in book_store database.
Sessions are working well for both.
USER can only see the list of book without EDIT button.
